        "description": "I am 30 years old, I have worked on projects where I have applied my knowledge to develop attractive and responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In addition, I am familiar with the use and libraries and frameworks such as React, which allow me to build dynamic and interactive web applications. I also trained in server-side development using Node.js, where I have created Apis and complete web applications. I am comfortable working with databases, implementing business logic and ensuring application security. I enjoy facing new challenges and collaborating in multi-disciplinary teams. Previously I worked in environmental engineering and teaching as a professor. "
